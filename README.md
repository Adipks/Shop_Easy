# Shop_Easy
This project demonstrates the implementation of Django framework to develop a web application. The web application developed here is    an E-commerce website which is named Shop-Easy. The website was developed with the help of HTML,Bootstrap,CSS,javascript for the front end and Django's framework provided a base to develop the backend using python. All the data used by the website is taken from a SQL-Database connected through Django. This project shows Django's object relational mapping feature while creating tables to hold data.  On the whole, the website fetches and retrieves data between the database and the web page to make an effective E-commerce website for shoppers.
